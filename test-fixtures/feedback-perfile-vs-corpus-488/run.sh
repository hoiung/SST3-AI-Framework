# feedback-perfile-vs-corpus-488 fixture (dotfiles#488 AC 3.2 concrete
# 4-step proof + AC 5.3(b)).
#
# Proves the Fix-C per-file commit hook does NOT regress the dotfiles#486
# silent-rot invariant, because the retained whole-corpus CI catch
# (AC 3.2(i-a) `leader-feedback-aggregate.sh --summarize`, non-swallowed)
# still fires on a file broken in an EARLIER commit. The 4 steps (exit
# codes recorded inline per the AC):
#   (1) a VALID feedback file parses clean                  -> exit 0
#   (2) a LATER commit corrupts an UNRELATED EARLIER file's
#       heading to bare `## Stage 1` (the #486/#488 halt class)
#   (3) the whole-corpus --summarize over the corrupted
#       corpus exits NON-ZERO  (short-circuits did NOT mask
#       it: --summarize forces regenerate_index --rebuild)   -> exit != 0
#   (4) a PER-FILE run scoped to ONLY commit (2)'s own file
#       PASSES (this is the gap the whole-corpus catch closes:
#       the rewired per-file commit hook correctly lets
#       commit (2) through — its own file is fine)           -> exit 0
# Uses the SST3_FEEDBACK_DIR test seam so the real corpus is untouched.
# Exit 0 = governance invariant preserved; exit 1 = regression.
