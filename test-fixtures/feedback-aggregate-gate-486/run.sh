# feedback-aggregate-gate-486 fixture (#486).
# Regression gate for the commit-path strict/advisory split in
# leader-feedback-aggregate.sh. The every-commit pre-commit hook
# (`sst3-metrics-feedback-drift`) runs `--summarize`. Asserts:
#   A. clean in-scope corpus            -> --summarize exit 0
#   B. + a broken in-scope file         -> --summarize exit != 0  (AC5: hard
#                                          parse failure BLOCKS the commit;
#                                          this is the silent-rot regression
#                                          guard — pre-#486 --summarize was 0)
#   C. clean + a non-conforming-filename
#      file (not a telemetry file)      -> --summarize exit 0 + stderr WARNING
#                                          (AC7: a misfiled draft must NOT
#                                          wedge the gate / force --no-verify)
# Uses the SST3_FEEDBACK_DIR test seam so the real corpus is never touched.
# AC6 (advisory DRIFT never blocks) is proven on the real corpus in the
# Issue #486 Verification Loop; synthesising a 5-weighted-didnt DRIFT corpus
# here would be fixture overengineering for no extra signal.
