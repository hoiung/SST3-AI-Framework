# SST3 Solo Workflow

> Wrapper-lane replaced the deprecated daemon-MCP in #445 (history: `git log --grep="#445"`).

**Subagents**: research, read, audit, plan, verify. NEVER write code, create issues, or implement. **Main agent**: collates findings, writes /tmp, creates issues, implements, commits, merges.

<!-- stages: 4 -->
## The 5-Stage Sequential Workflow

**CRITICAL**: ORDER-DEPENDENT. No skipping, no reordering.

<!-- stages: 1 -->
### Stage 1 — Research (Subagent Swarm → /tmp)

- [ ] Check `docs/research/` for existing research on this domain first
- [ ] **MANDATORY self-test + status CHECK at Stage 1 top** (#447 Phase 4; #484 W6.2 — WORKFLOW ↔ Leader.md:57 ↔ SST3-solo.md "MANDATORY wrapper-lane self-test + status CHECK" block consistency: WORKFLOW.md previously omitted the self-test gate the other two enforce). Run `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-self-test.sh` **FIRST** — the wrapper-lane regression gate. ANY drift line in the NDJSON (`{"kind":"fixture-drift",...}`) means a wrapper regressed against its frozen known-answer fixture; **ABORT swarm dispatch**, open `solo/wrapper-fix-<bug>` (NOT this Issue's branch), reproduce + fix, push through its own Stage 4, then resume. (Evaluate on a clean working tree — a doc/code-scanning fixture transiently reports drift while an edit is unstaged; that is not a wrapper regression if `wrapper drift` count is 0.) Then run `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-status.sh` unconditionally and record `last_updated` + `file_count` in the research file — audit trail for Stage 5 reviewers, even on 12-moments topics. The wrapper-lane is stateless; there is no staleness or build step. `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-update.sh` is a no-op contract-preservation shim and may be invoked anywhere docs cite it without effect. For doc + sync auditing, the Layer-2 orchestrator `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-check.sh` (Phase D) composes A+B+C — invoke via `/sync-check` skill or directly. See `docs/guides/code-query-playbook.md` "Stage-Mapped Recipes".
- [ ] **Doc-lane is diff-triggered, NOT graph-gated** (#484 W6.1 — resolves the `graph_applicable` overload). `graph_applicable` gates ONLY the CODE SEED (`sst3-code-callers`/`callees`/`search`/`impact`). The DOC lane (`sst3-doc-lint`/`sst3-doc-links`/`sst3-doc-frontmatter`/`sst3-doc-toc`/`sst3-doc-yaml`) runs **whenever the diff touches `*.md` / frontmatter / docs, regardless of `graph_applicable`** — mirroring how `sst3-code-status.sh` runs unconditionally for audit. A semantic / voice / cross-document Issue (`graph_applicable=false`) still runs the doc-lane on its `*.md` diff (this is why a governance-only Issue is NOT exempt from doc linting). Skip-clean only when the diff touches no `*.md` / frontmatter / doc file.
- [ ] **Pre-swarm graph SEED** (STANDARDS.md "Structural Code Queries"): if the research topic is structural code in a supported language, use graph to DEFINE scope BEFORE dispatching the swarm — not to verify pre-formed scope AFTER. Run `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-callers.sh <symbol> <lang>` / `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-search.sh '<pattern>' <lang>` on every symbol the USER MENTIONED in the task description, plus `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-impact.sh <base-branch>` on user-named files. Feed the resulting evidence into subagent prompts so layer-1 angles are scoped to real call-sites / symbols / blast-radius — not hypothesis. Graph SEEDS the swarm; it does NOT replace its different-angle coverage. Skip-condition: if the topic is semantic / voice / intent / cross-document / non-code (one of the 12 subagent-only moments), skip graph queries; go straight to swarm. (The status freshness CHECK above still runs unconditionally for audit trail.)
- [ ] Launch MANY parallel subagents, each with focused area (5 files max per subagent). Subagents remain required for the 12 subagent-only moments.
- [ ] **Layer-2 adversarial gap-finder MANDATORY** (Theme 8, #477; AP #14 instantiation): after the Layer-1 swarm completes, dispatch a Layer-2 subagent with prompt: "Layer-1 found X, Y, Z. Find 3 things they missed — false-positive claims with modern equivalents OR genuine gaps not yet surfaced." Layer-2 prompt MUST differ from Layer-1 (per AP #14c). For infrastructure / governance / cross-cutting Issues this angle is load-bearing — generic Layer-1 coverage misses scope-adjacent gaps. Canonical rule: STANDARDS.md "Stage 1 Layer-2 Adversarial Gap-Finder Discipline"; cross-reference: ANTI-PATTERNS.md AP #14d. Procedure expanded in Leader.md Stage 1 step 2a.
- [ ] Main context = orchestrator only — NEVER read source files directly in main context
- [ ] Research phase must use <30% of context budget
- [ ] Main agent collates all subagent findings into /tmp file containing: **findings + gaps + plan**. Record any wrapper-lane calls used + `last_updated` + `file_count` + spot-check source file:line. Also record `graph_applicable: true|false (reason: <class>)` — downstream stages MUST read this field and NOT re-derive the classification independently (single-declaration-carries-forward). (`graph_applicable` is the historical field name retained for downstream-stage carry-forward; it gates whether wrapper-lane queries are run.)
- [ ] Output /tmp file for user review before proceeding to Stage 2
- [ ] Per-stage feedback per STANDARDS.md §Per-Stage Feedback Capture — write the Stage 1 block before declaring complete

<!-- stages: 1,2 -->
### Stage 2 — Issue Creation (Main Agent from /tmp Research)

- [ ] Use `../templates/issue-template.md` — NEVER create issues from scratch
- [ ] Add ALL before/after illustrations for comparison after implementation
- [ ] Add compact breaks between phases in Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Check context memory — stop and allow compact before continuing if needed
- [ ] Multiple subagents for full coverage scope-check vs audit
- [ ] Quality mantras listed VERBATIM in issue scope — not summarized:
  - No inefficiencies, fix optimisation opportunities
  - Reliable and robust (not prone to breakage or failing)
  - Dedupe duplicate codes
  - No bottlenecks
  - Runs super fast and safe
  - No memory leaks using preventions
  - Follows STANDARDS.md
- [ ] No false positives — everything real gets fixed
- [ ] No such thing as high priority or low priority — all must be fixed
- [ ] Per-stage feedback per STANDARDS.md §Per-Stage Feedback Capture — write the Stage 2 block before declaring complete

<!-- stages: always -->
### Stage 3 — Triple-Check (Subagents Verify Scope)

- [ ] Scope vs audit doc = 100% captured, nothing missing, no gaps
- [ ] No overengineering — only what was agreed
- [ ] Check against chat history — don't forget things discussed and agreed on
- [ ] Verify no tendency to scope the opposite of what was agreed
- [ ] Check for dead/obsolete/legacy code cleanup opportunities
- [ ] <a id="quality-mantras"></a> **Stage-3 Quality Mantras Checkbox (5-item operational subset of [STANDARDS.md Quality Mantras (Doctrinal)](../standards/STANDARDS.md#quality-mantras))** <!-- subset of STANDARDS.md Quality Mantras (Doctrinal) -->: confirm the Stage-3 audit applied no-inefficiencies / reliable+robust / dedupe / no-bottlenecks-and-leaks / follows-STANDARDS.md. The doctrinal 9-item list is canonical at STANDARDS.md; this subset is the operational checkbox shape Stage 3 runs.
- [ ] All scope goes in issue BODY — never in comments (comments are temporal, body is permanent)
- [ ] Per-stage feedback per STANDARDS.md §Per-Stage Feedback Capture — write the Stage 3 block before declaring complete

<!-- stages: 4 -->
### Stage 4 — Implementation + Merge + User Review

- [ ] Implement all phases from issue Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Commit after EACH file change: `git add {file} && git commit -m "type: description (#issue)" && git push`
- [ ] Run Verification Loop (repeat until clean — see below)
- [ ] Run Ralph Review: Haiku → Sonnet → Opus (all 3 mandatory)
- [ ] Merge BEFORE user review (protects work) — recursion-safe remote fast-forward, NO shared-tree checkout (dotfiles#488 Fix-A / Leader.md Gate 2 / AC 1.3):
  - From the worktree: `git push origin <solo-branch>` then `git push origin <solo-branch>:master` (server-side FF of `origin/master`)
  - On non-FF reject: `git fetch origin master` → `git rebase origin/master` (in worktree) → retry (≤3, NEVER `--force`); NO shared-tree branch-switch/local-merge/reset
  - `ExitWorktree action:keep` until `git ls-remote origin master` == solo tip, then `action:remove`; `git push origin --delete <solo-branch>`; `git fetch --prune`
- [ ] POST `user-review-checklist.md` from TEMPLATE — not made up, ALL sections mandatory, NONE optional
- [ ] Work through checklist WITH user
- [ ] Fix any gaps found — no deferrals, no excuses unless confirmed false positive
- [ ] User approves
- [ ] Per-stage feedback per STANDARDS.md §Per-Stage Feedback Capture — write the Stage 4 block (per-Ralph-tier sub-bullets in `worked` + `ralph_restarts` in `friction`) before declaring complete

<!-- stages: 1,4,5 -->
### Stage 5 — Post-Implementation Review (Subagent Swarm)

- [ ] Review against issue body scope, goal alignment, and design doc
- [ ] **Audit Research Preservation**: if the issue research phase produced 3+ external sources, verify all have been captured in `docs/research/` per `research-reference-guide.md` schema (YAML frontmatter, canonical filename `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-description-issue-NNN.md`, quality score ≥8/10). Checklist template: `archive/stage-6-retrospective.md` Section 3.1 [SST2 legacy].
- [ ] **Wiring check**: Everything wired up properly — common failure: fix/enhance/refactor but forget to wire up to existing functions
- [ ] **Graph-backed diff audit** (when graph available per STANDARDS.md "Structural Code Queries"): `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-review.sh <default-branch>` (use `main` or `master` per repo default) generates a diff-scoped context block (changed files + blast radius + untested-function warnings + wide-blast-radius flags). Feed this into ONE of the subagent audit prompts. Subagents still do the semantic wiring / intent / cross-document audits. Graph findings feed subagents, never replace them.
- [ ] Check for: inefficiencies, dead code from refactors, optimisation opportunities
- [ ] Reliable and robust (not prone to breakage or failing)
- [ ] Duplications that need dedupe, bottlenecks
- [ ] No memory leaks using preventions
- [ ] Follows STANDARDS.md
- [ ] Check issue body scope 100% completed — no gaps
- [ ] Fix ALL problems — no deferrals, no excuses
- [ ] Run regression tests — if not run yet, run them now
- [ ] **Task-close drain gate (#493 Phase 2 — Leader.md step 7a.1)**: `bash <your-dotfiles-clone>/SST3/scripts/leader-stage5-drain-check.sh <issue-number> [--repo <repo>]` exit 0 mandatory before sign-off. Detects D1-D5 residue (uncommitted task-touched files / self-created stash / self-opened worktree / un-pushed commits / unfinished propagation tail). Sits BETWEEN the 7a.0 sweep and the 7a completeness-check in Leader.md Stage 5 sequence; Layer B failsafe replays in `.github/workflows/stage5-completeness.yml`.
- [ ] Per-stage feedback per STANDARDS.md §Per-Stage Feedback Capture — write the Stage 5 block before declaring complete

<!-- stages: 5 -->
## Verification Loop

- [ ] **Scope completeness gate**: Enumerate every Acceptance Criteria checkbox from issue body. For EACH one: state file:line that implements it. Any checkbox without file:line = NOT DONE. Do NOT proceed until all checkboxes have evidence.
- [ ] **Checkbox-MCP coverage gate (AP #20)**: **(0) Auto-tick precondition** (#477 Phase 6 AC 6.6 — Theme 6): inspect `SST3-metrics/.tier-a-auto-tick/<issue#>-<phase>.json` and the Issue body for `PoW [<ac_id>]: ... (auto-ticked via tier-a-auto-tick.yml)` lines. If every Tier-A box for the just-completed phase is already `[x]` with auto-tick evidence, document in the checkpoint comment ("Tier-A auto-tick processor closed N/N boxes for Phase M") and skip directly to step (4) re-verification. If no (hook unavailable / GHA disabled / sentinel never written / box-text drift caused matcher miss / network failure), proceed with manual MCP invocation in steps (1)-(3) below. Manual MCP override remains the AP #20 fallback. **(1)** if `mcp__github-checkbox__get_issue_checkboxes` is deferred, load its schema via `ToolSearch(select:mcp__github-checkbox__get_issue_checkboxes,mcp__github-checkbox__update_issue_checkbox)` per STANDARDS.md "MCP Tool Schema Loading" — bootstrap step, mandatory before the gate runs. **(2)** run `get_issue_checkboxes` and list every Tier-A box still `[ ]` that corresponds to completed work. **(3)** for each such box, invoke `update_issue_checkbox(issue_number, exact_checkbox_text, evidence)` with canonical evidence (file:line / commit hash / command+output / subagent RESULT comment-id per `../reference/tool-selection-guide.md` Example 2). **(4)** re-run `get_issue_checkboxes` and confirm every Tier-A box is `[x]`. Comment-only progress = FAIL. If this gate fails, use `update_issue_checkbox` to close every remaining box with evidence within this Gate 1 run (in-issue retroactivity, not historical — historical drift is handled separately) before declaring Gate 1 clean.
- [ ] All checkboxes verified with evidence
- [ ] Overengineering check: simpler solution exists?
- [ ] Architecture reuse check: duplicated instead of reused?
- [ ] Code duplication check: needs deduplication?
- [ ] Fallback policy check: silent failures?
- [ ] **Wiring check — 4 parts** (structural layer: `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-callers.sh <function> <lang>` + `bash dotfiles/scripts/sst3-code-impact.sh <base-branch>` when graph available per STANDARDS.md "Structural Code Queries"; semantic layer: subagent verifies each caller handles the new contract correctly. Document both layers in the RESULT block. If graph unavailable / stale / unsupported-language, fall back to grep + subagent and document why.):
  1. Every new function/method is called from at least one caller (`query callers_of(<name>)` first; grep fallback for unsupported languages)
  2. Every config key added to YAML is read by code (grep for key name in source — zero results = dead config). YAML is unsupported by graph, so grep is the primary tool here.
  3. Every SQL query's column names exist in the target table (verify with `\d tablename` or migration file)
  4. Every None-producing code path: confirm callee's type annotation accepts `Optional` / has null guard
- [ ] **Marker-substring enumeration (AP #24, #477 Phase 4 AC 4.4)**: if the change introduces, modifies, or removes a marker substring (error-message partition, counter name, diagnostic flag, feature-gate literal, status-enum value, log-line prefix, partition key), run `grep -rn -F '<exact_marker_substring>' src/ tests/ scripts/ --include='*.py'` (or per-language equivalent) and confirm the count matches the Stage 1 baseline recorded in the Issue body as "Known Emit Sites: (N)". Mismatch = FAIL — either implementation added emission sites that should have been in scope (expand scope) or removed sites that shouldn't have changed (revert removal). Skip-clean if no marker substring change in this Issue. Canonical rule: `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` AP #24 (Marker-Substring Changes Without Full Emit-Site Enumeration); cross-reference: `STANDARDS.md` "Marker-Substring Discipline".
- [ ] **Three-Tier test gate (canonical — Leader.md + SST3-solo.md defer here; #484 T4.1)**. the operator's rule (verbatim Source block, STANDARDS.md "Three-Tier Testing Framework"): the three tiers compose, none substitutes — "3 forms as they work together". **BUILD: always all 3** (every change ships with Unit + Workflow + E2E tests that EXIST — no "this is only a unit, skip 2/3" exemption at authoring time). **USE: scope-matched** (which tiers must fire/pass at this loop matches the change scope). The project test suite — what "no regressions" means — is the union of the checked-in Unit + Workflow + E2E tests, NOT a synonym for any single tier (STANDARDS.md glossary).
  - [ ] **Unit Tier — cog/piston QC** (canonical: STANDARDS.md "Three-Tier Testing Framework" → Unit Tier + "Test-Prod Call Coverage Discipline"). BUILD: every changed/added unit (public callable / response-payload field / config key) has a checked-in test that exercises it — the call-seam gate; an untested unit is a piston nobody QC'd. USE: fires for any code change; document the scope-skip for a doc-only / governance diff. Run the project test suite here — no regressions.
  - [ ] **Workflow Tier — the assembled engine** (canonical: STANDARDS.md "Three-Tier Testing Framework" → Workflow Tier; ANTI-PATTERNS.md AP #18 "Smoke-Tested Pipeline Shipped Without End-to-End Sample Run (Workflow-Tier validation)"). BUILD: a workflow/integration test + the AP #18 real-CLI sample-invocation artefact exist for the component. USE: fires when the change affects how units connect — pipeline / backtest / SL1 / SL2 / orchestration / CLI-wiring / cross-module function-arg propagation / **persistent-state write (JSONB schema mutation, SQL literal drift across SET and READ sites, DB column rename, enum-value drift)** / **any `../scripts/sst3-*.sh` wrapper change**. When it fires: a REAL-CLI sample invocation (service shapes: 8-item liquid basket against real DB; wrapper-script shapes: ≥3 repo shapes auto_pb / voice-doc-repo / dotfiles + raw-tool counter-query for recall comparison). Exit code 0 alone INSUFFICIENT — verify row-count landed, downstream consumers succeeded, contamination audit OK, wrapper-vs-raw delta within tolerance. Mocks MUST assert `call_args.kwargs[...]` explicitly (a `**kwargs`-swallowing mock proves nothing). Document the sample log path + verification queries + wrapper/raw delta in an Issue comment. A pure single-unit change need not fire it — document the scope-skip reason.
  - [ ] **E2E Tier — the driving test** (canonical: STANDARDS.md "Three-Tier Testing Framework" → E2E Tier; ANTI-PATTERNS.md AP #26 "E2E System Verification"). BUILD: an end-to-end/system test exists for the system path. USE: fires when the change affects how whole components connect end-to-end — multi-component / cross-repo contract / orchestration / persistent-state spanning the pipeline / a contract a real downstream consumer reads. When it fires: exercise against the real system (real DB + real downstream consumer + live invocation); confirm the downstream consumer accepted the real contract and the system produced the intended result end-to-end (real-DB schema / enum / contract drift surfaced if present). A Workflow-Tier sample alone is NOT sufficient for a system-scope change — the three compose, none substitutes. A single-unit/workflow change does not fire it — document the scope-skip reason.
- [ ] **Quality scan**: No inefficiencies, no bottlenecks, no memory leaks, no dead code, STANDARDS.md compliant
- [ ] **Raw-tool cross-validation gate (#447 Phase 5)**: if any Verification-Loop check above used `../scripts/sst3-code-*.sh` output as load-bearing evidence (callers count, large-fn list, dead-code candidates, blast-radius, untested-py results), dispatch ONE Layer-3 subagent to run the raw equivalent (grep / direct ast-grep / find / git log) and compute delta. Wrapper says 0 + raw says ≥1 = wrapper recall miss = FAIL the originating check until reconciled. Wrapper says N + raw says M with `|N-M|/max(N,M) > 0.2` = wrapper-lane SUSPECT, file a `solo/wrapper-fix-<bug>` Issue. The 20% bound is empirical (#445 R4 wrappers landed at 0% delta on structural angles).
- [ ] **Mirror-lane verification (#460 Phase 8 W5 — AP #9 single-source-edits enforcement)**: when ANY change touches a canonical file with mirror entries in `SST3/drift-manifest.json` (`vendored_files` lane B) OR the SST3 section above the boundary marker in CLAUDE.md (template lane A), BOTH lanes must be exercised. Lane A: `python3 <your-dotfiles-clone>/SST3/scripts/propagate-template.py --all --dry-run` exit 0 (no SST3 section drift across consumers). Lane B: `python3 <your-dotfiles-clone>/SST3/scripts/propagate-mirrors.py --dry-run` exit 0 + `python3 <your-dotfiles-clone>/SST3/scripts/propagate-mirrors.py --validate` exit 0 (no mirror drift, no missing manifest entries). Failure on either lane blocks Gate 1 until reconciled. Skip-clean when the diff touches no canonical-mirror-tracked surface.

<!-- stages: 4 -->
## Per-Stage Feedback Capture

Canonical: STANDARDS.md §Per-Stage Feedback Capture (the single source of truth — schema, channel-separation rule, FP-handling rule, DRIFT ALERT spec, activation-sha gate, post-compact reconstruction protocol, 3-layer enforcement). When creating a new per-issue feedback file, copy the write-time template `../templates/leader-feedback-template.md` (canonical frontmatter + `## Stage N — <Title>` H2 headings + 10 `**field**:` lines) — never hand-roll the structure (the bare-heading halt class, dotfiles#486/#488). Each stage above ends with a per-stage feedback bullet. Aggregator + reporter + shape-match: see `../scripts/leader-feedback-aggregate.sh --report | --summarize | --shape-match | --staleness`. Pre-commit hook `sst3-metrics-feedback-present` is Layer A; persistent sentinels under `.sentinels/` (gitignored) are Layer B; the per-stage bullets above are Layer C.

<!-- stages: 4 -->
## Branch & Commit Discipline

Worktree-per-agent is canonical (dotfiles#488 Fix-A). A clone has one HEAD/index; a concurrent agent's branch-create otherwise moves yours. The authoritative trigger is the CLAUDE.md "Branch Safety (CRITICAL — DO NOT VIOLATE)" anchor (the `EnterWorktree` tool only activates from a user/CLAUDE.md/memory directive). `NEVER switch branches` mid-implementation remains the in-worktree invariant — correct *inside* an isolated worktree.

```bash
# Isolate: EnterWorktree tool, named solo/issue-{number}-{description}
#   (NOT a bare `git checkout -b solo/...` in the shared clone — #488 Fix-A).

# HARD STOP: NEVER switch branches mid-implementation (in-worktree invariant)
# NEVER use git add -A or git add . — stage files individually

# After EACH file change (in the worktree, on its solo branch)
git add {file}
git commit -m "type: description (#issue)"
git push origin <solo-branch>

# Merge + cleanup — recursion-safe remote fast-forward (Leader.md Gate 2 / #488 AC 1.3):
#   git push origin <solo-branch>:master   # server-side FF of origin/master
#   on non-FF reject: git fetch origin master; git rebase origin/master (in worktree); retry (<=3, NEVER --force)
#   NO shared-tree branch-switch / local-merge / reset.
# Then: ExitWorktree action:keep until push landed (git ls-remote origin master == solo tip),
#   ExitWorktree action:remove; git push origin --delete <solo-branch>; git fetch --prune
```
