# Gate 3 — User-Review-Checklist Post (#498 AC 4.1)

Final Stage-4 gate. Runs AFTER Gate 2 merge lands on origin/master. Uses the `../../templates/user-review-checklist.md` template VERBATIM; do NOT invent custom checklist forms.

<!-- stages: 4 -->
## Canonical procedure

1. Read `../../templates/user-review-checklist.md`. Use the TEMPLATE — do NOT invent your own.
2. Fill ALL 10 sections. None are optional:
   - Scope Verification
   - Context Checkpoint
   - Gap Analysis — No Excuses Gate
   - How It Works
   - Cross-Issue Impact
   - Discoverability Check
   - Fail Fast Audit
   - Modular Architecture Review
   - Post-Implementation Review Gate
   - Closure Gate
3. Post the completed checklist as a comment on the GitHub Issue.
4. Report to operator: what was merged, Issue URL, checklist comment URL.

## §3 Gap Analysis — No-Excuses Gate (post-Cut-#9 contract)

Every item in §3 "Items Not Fixed" MUST carry one of three explicit flags (canonical: template §3 + Leader.md Stage 5 §3-Deferral angle):
- `[deferred-FP: <evidence>]` — confirmed false positive
- `[deferred-N/A: <rationale>]` — intentional descope
- `[deferred-tracking-issue: <issue#>]` — moved to a referenced OPEN issue. **OPEN-state check (#555 Phase 3):** before recording, `gh issue view <N> --json state` must return OPEN — a closed target re-classifies as `deferred-N/A` (closure as the rationale) or gets a NEW tracking issue; a closed target silently collapses a tracked deferral into an unreviewed decision.

Items without any flag default to UNVERIFIED → trigger Stage 5 re-litigation. **F-15 (#498)**: this applies to the AGENT's own §3 entries — no self-exemption.
