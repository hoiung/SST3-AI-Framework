"""
Cross-Repo Path Validation Prevention for SST3 (Issue #298)

Purpose:
- Prevent SST3 markdown files from using relative paths that break cross-repo references
- Ensure all SST3 file references use ../dotfiles/SST3/ prefix for discoverability
- Catch patterns like `SST3/`, `../templates/`, `../workflow/` that should be `../dotfiles/SST3/...`

Problem Solved:
When SST3 docs reference other SST3 files using repo-relative paths (e.g., `workflow/...`),
those paths work from dotfiles repo but BREAK from other repos (<consumer-public-1>, <consumer-public-2>).
This makes SST3 features undiscoverable from other repos, violating the discoverability requirement.

Correct Pattern:
- From dotfiles repo: `workflow/WORKFLOW.md` (repo-relative)
- From other repos: `../workflow/WORKFLOW.md` (cross-repo)
- SST3 docs should use: `../workflow/WORKFLOW.md` (works everywhere)

Exceptions:
- CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md: Intentionally uses repo-relative paths (template for other repos)
- Code blocks showing "wrong" examples (prefixed with ❌ or "DON'T:")
- Paths already using `../dotfiles/SST3/` (correct format)
- Flattened standalone public mirror (MIRROR-CONTRACT.md at the content root):
  the whole check is skipped — sibling paths like `../standards/` are correct
  there, not cross-repo violations (dotfiles#553).

Usage:
  python scripts/check-crossrepo-paths.py                # Check for violations
  python scripts/check-crossrepo-paths.py --fix          # Show suggested fixes (dry-run)
  python scripts/check-crossrepo-paths.py --verbose      # Verbose output

Exit codes:
  0: No violations found
  1: Violations found (BLOCKS commit)
