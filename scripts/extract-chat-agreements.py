"""
Extract the operator's genuine typed chat messages from a Claude Code session
transcript so a verifier panel can reconcile the implementation against what was
actually agreed in chat (vs only the Issue scope).

Claude Code records every session as newline-delimited JSON at
  ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<session-uuid>.jsonl
where <cwd-slug> is the working directory with every `/` replaced by `-`
(e.g. /home/you/projects/my-app -> -home-you-projects-my-app).
The transcript survives compaction, so it is the authoritative record of what the
operator actually said — memory and handovers are not.

Three record classes carry operator decisions and all three are read
(dotfiles#555 AC 0.6):
  - `type:"user"` records — typed prose, in `type:"text"` content parts
  - `type:"queue-operation"` records — a message typed WHILE the agent was busy
    is queued and recorded here; it is also replayed as a user turn on dequeue,
    but that replay is not guaranteed to survive every session boundary
  - AskUserQuestion answers — the operator's menu selections arrive as a
    `tool_result` part answering an `AskUserQuestion` tool_use, never as text.
    dotfiles#552 lost SIX consequential decisions this way: the panel
    reconciled against a record containing none of them.

This script reads those JSONL files and recovers ONLY genuine operator-typed
turns, dropping harness-injected noise:
  - tool_result content parts (function outputs)
  - <system-reminder> / <command-*> / <local-command-*> / <bash-*> wrappers
  - skill-body injections (the rendered slash-command body sent as a user turn)
  - compaction summaries ("This session is being continued ...")
  - "[Request interrupted by user]" markers
  - isMeta / isSidechain turns (subagent sidechains, meta events)

The recovered messages are emitted as a `## Agreements Log` markdown block
(default) or JSON (--json) for the Stage 1/3/5 verifier panel to interpret with
fresh eyes — it is shown ONLY these raw messages, never the scope, so its
interpretation is independent.

Exit codes:
  0  success — at least one operator message recovered
  1  usage / IO error (project dir or session file missing / unreadable)
  2  parsed cleanly but recovered ZERO operator messages (caller decides — this
     is suspicious for a non-empty session and is surfaced distinctly)
  3  a record class was seen that is neither parsed nor knowingly ignored — the
     transcript format has moved and this tool may be dropping operator
     decisions. Fail loud rather than under-report with exit 0 (#555 AC 0.6).

Issue: hoiung/dotfiles#522 Phase 5 (verifier-led chat reconciliation);
       hoiung/dotfiles#555 AC 0.6 (queue-operation + AskUserQuestion + fail-loud).
