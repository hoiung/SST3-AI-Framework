# Total SST3 token limits (updated for 1M context window, #399)
# Previous caps (100K) were set for 200K context (50% budget).
# New caps (150K) are 15% of 1M — conservative, leaves 850K for actual work.

    "SST3/workflow": 10000,    # actual ~2,239 — was 44000 (massively over-allocated)
    "SST3/standards": 25000,   # raised 2026-04-08 18000->20000 for AP #9-#14 + Subagent Discipline; raised 2026-04-19 20000->22000 for AP #19 + Structural Code Queries subsection (#419). Partially offset by compressing the inline 12-moment prose (now an AP #19 pointer in the "Structural Code Queries" section, STANDARDS.md:346) (saved ~130 words, #420 Phase 2 item 13). Raised 2026-04-21 22000->25000 for round-5 N32 Double-Guardrail Principle + TA-7 data-layer gate (STANDARDS.md 6th pre-query gate) + TB-5 Rule 8 orchestrator-prop (#427).

    # Registered #555 AC 2.1 — the slash-command session-load surface (Leader.md
    # alone was 104,913 B with zero stage tags). Sized to the post-AC-2.6
    # relocation target (~27K tokens actual once Leader.md drops under 70,000 B);
    # over-budget at registration time by design — the breach is the Phase-2
    # work-signal, and the default run stays advisory (AC 2.2). In the public
    # mirror the directory is `claude/commands` (no leading dot) — the size
    # walker tolerates both layouts.
